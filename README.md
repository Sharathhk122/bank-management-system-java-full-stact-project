👉 This gives you **20 screenshots + placeholders for GIF animations** so your README looks as visually **interactive** as your HTML landing page.  

Do you want me to also **create a Markdown grid gallery layout** (4x5 style) for the screenshots instead of a vertical list? That would make the README look more like a **modern portfolio showcase**.
```
